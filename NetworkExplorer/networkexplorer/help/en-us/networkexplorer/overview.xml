                The key features of Network Explorer are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Searching and retrieving network objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Saving collections of objects (Collections) or your search query (Saved Searches) with a
                    desired name, in order to view it at a later time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using search results in other applications. Some applications can be launched directly from
                    Network Explorer. Other applications can use Network Explorer to search for and return search results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each search result, Collection and Saved Search in Network Explorer has a unique URL. This allows
                    it to be bookmarked and shared. Your Collections and Saved Searches will need to be public in order
                    to share with others.
                </li>
            </ul>
