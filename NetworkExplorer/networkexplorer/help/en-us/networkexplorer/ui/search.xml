            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>
                Network Explorer is used to search across Managed Objects. To accomplish this, Network Explorer
                has an intuitive search syntax that is designed to be easily read and flexible for user input.
                For more information see the <xref href="../tutorials.xml" type="concept">search tutorial</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Network Explorer returns instances of all Managed Object versions deployed (results may vary depending on whether you are linked to a TBAC group or not).
                As you type, your query's syntax will be validated. If there is an error in your syntax, the search
                button will be disabled, and a warning icon will display to the left of the search field. You can see at
                which character an error is by hovering over the warning icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each section below states how and when a particular syntax can be used, providing "real world" examples.
                Additional information regarding attribute lookup is included where applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
                A long-hand version of the syntax is documented only for the purpose of editing the syntax generated by
                the Search Criteria Builder tool. This can be viewed when switching from a query built with Search
                Criteria Builder to a standard search box query.

            <title>Case Sensitivity</title>
            <p>
                Managed Object types and their attributes are not case sensitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Network Explorer syntax should be entered in lower case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collection and Saved Search names are case sensitive.

            <title>Auto-complete</title>
            <p>
                As you type your search query, a list of suggested keywords are provided. These suggestions are filtered
                as you type, and new keywords will be displayed when you add a space after a completed keyword.
                To select a keyword, click the option, and the suggestion is included in the search field.

            <title>Single Search Query</title>
            <p>A single word query can have a number of different meanings.
                Network Explorer evaluates the meaning of the word in the query using the following execution rules
                and
                order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Node Name:</p>
                    <p>
                        An MO is returned to represent the node. One of the following MOs is returned:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MeContext</li>
                        <li>ManagedElement</li>
                        <li>NetworkElement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Each node returns a single MO instance to avoid duplication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: If a node name contains unsupported special character(s), name needs to be wrapped in quotes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>MO Type:</p>
                    <p>
                        Instance(s) of that type are returned.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Collection:</p>
                    <p>
                        Collection contents are returned. Private Collections are returned before public Collections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a selected collection/searched collection is modified by users either by adding or removing Nodes / Managed Objects by a different Network Explorer instance or other application of ENM, a notification is reported to Network Explorer opened page, that the selected collection is not up to the date and user is provided with an option to refresh the contents displayed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If multiple collections are modified by users either by adding or removing Nodes / Managed Objects or moving the Managed Objects between two collections by a different Network Explorer instance or other application of ENM, a notification is reported to Network Explorer opened page, that the selected collections are not up to the date and user is provided with an option to refresh the contents displayed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The new collection name will be appended to the current notification if the user chooses to select a different collection and does not click on Refresh or Close the current Notification. This also applies if another instance of Network Explorer or another application of ENM changes the selected collection. The maximum number of collections for which the names of the collections may show in alerts is five. The message will provide the names of the first five collections and offer a count of the remaining collections if more than five collections are updated and no action is taken.

                    <p>
                        When Apply Recursively check box is selected and any of the child or nested collection collections under selected Parent collection is modified by users either by adding or removing Nodes / Managed Objects by a different Network Explorer instance or other application of ENM, a notification is reported to Network Explorer opened page, that the selected collection is not up to the date and user is provided with an option to refresh the contents displayed.
                    </p>
                    <image href="../resources/images/webpush_applyRecursive.png"/>
                    <p>
                        On clicking the Refresh link when "Apply Recursively" check box is selected, all the child and nested child collection(s) nodes along with the direct child node(s) of the selected collection will get display in the result page.
                    </p>

                    <p>Saved Search:</p>
                    <p>
                        Saved Search contents are returned. Private Saved Searches are returned before public Saved
                        Searches.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b>
                If naming collisions occur, the first match is used. It is advised not to name Saved Searches
                and Collections with the same name.
