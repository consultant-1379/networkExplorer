                The SubNetwork provides a flexible way to define a network topology. A top most parent SubNetwork
                instance can also have a SubNetwork child and a SubNetwork grandchild, therefore 3 tiers of SubNetwork
                are possible.

                Network Explorer provides the following syntax to allow a user to assemble
                a query describing all three layers:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                <b>SubNetwork</b> where object <b>SubNetwork</b> has child MeContext
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                SubNetwork syntax in Criteria Builder follows the same pattern as the above.
