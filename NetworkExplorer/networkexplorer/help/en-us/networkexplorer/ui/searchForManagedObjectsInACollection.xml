            <p>
                To return objects that exist in a specific Collection, you can specify the type and Collection names
                using the following syntax, replacing [TYPE] and [COLLECTION_NAME] with the desired values:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] from collection [COLLECTION_NAME]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For Example - to get all ENodeBFunction from a Collection named "dublin_collection":
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                ENodeBFunction <b>from collection</b> dublin_collection
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also use different attribute conditions with the Collection syntax, like the following:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] from collection [COLLECTION_NAME] where [ATTRIBUTE_NAME] [OPERATOR] [ATTRIBUTE_VALUE]
            </codeblock>
            <codeblock>
                ENodeBFunction <b>from collection</b> dublin_city_center <b>where</b> eNBId <b>&gt;=</b> 507
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                However, Network Explorer does not support the "where" condition while intersecting Collections,
                for example, the following query is
                <b>NOT</b>
                supported:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select <b>collection</b> dublin_city_center <b>from collection</b> dublin_collection where dnsLookupTimer=108
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also search multiple Collections by specifying multiple Collection names using the following
                syntax:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] from collection [COLLECTION_NAME], collection [COLLECTION_NAME], ..
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For Example - to get all ENodeBFunction from a Collection named "dublin_collection" and Collection
                "dublin_city_center":
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                ENodeBFunction <b>from collection</b> dublin_collection, <b>collection</b> dublin_city_center
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also search by intersecting different Collections by using the following syntax:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                collection [COLLECTION_NAME] from collection [COLLECTION_NAME]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For Example - to get all managed objects existing in Collection "subsetcollection", and also exist in Collection "largecollection":
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                collection <b>subsetcollection</b> from collection <b>largecollection</b>
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                A Collection name containing spaces or special characters should be enclosed within double quotes.
                For example:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select collection <b>"dublin city center"</b> from collection dublin_collection
            </codeblock>
        </section>
    </conbody>
