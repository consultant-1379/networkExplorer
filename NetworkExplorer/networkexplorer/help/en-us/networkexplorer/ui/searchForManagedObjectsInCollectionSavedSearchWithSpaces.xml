                When searching for a Saved Search or Collection with a name that contains spaces, you must enclose the
                Saved Search or Collection name in double quotes. For example:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select MeContext from search "saved search with spaces"
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                When an entire search query is wrapped in double quotes, this will attempt to return a Collection with a
                name matching the query.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a Collection is not found it will attempt to return a Saved Search.
            </p>
            <p>
                If neither a Collection or a Saved Search is found, the query will be parsed as a normal search query.
            </p>
