            <title>Virtual Scrolling</title>
            <p>
                Results in Network Explorer are displayed in a table that uses Virtual Scrolling. With Virtual
                Scrolling all of the result set is displayed in a single page. You can scroll through a large result
                set using the scroll bar to the right of the results table. As the scroll bar is moved up or down the
                visible row index range is displayed as a scroll bar annotation to make it easier to find the required results.
                When a large request is executed the result rows are retrieved in stages. As you scroll through
                the result set new requests are made to get content not yet been loaded.

            <title>Sorting Search Results</title>
            <p>
                Results are initially sorted by Name. Results can be sorted manually by a chosen column.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click the column heading you want to sort by. The results will be sorted by that heading, first in
                ascending order. Click the heading again, to view the results in descending order.
                Values are treated as alpha-numeric strings. This means ID11 would precede ID2.
            </p>

            <fig>
                <title>
                    For example - a selection of results from a search, sorted by Name, would produce the following order
                    of the Name column
                </title>

                <b>Notes:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        IP addresses are treated as text and not numbers. Therefore, they are not sorted in numerical order.
                        For example, 170.110.65.95 precedes 170.70.65.95.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sorting on the "Sync Status (CM)" column when a node's sync state is in the process of a transition
                        between "UNSYNCHRONIZED" and "SYNCHRONIZED" states may result in that node's sync state changing
                        after the sort operation is complete.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Columns can be re-ordered by using the Table Settings. Table Settings is displayed by clicking the <b>Settings</b>
                button above the results table, sliding out from the right of the screen over the table. The columns can
                then be re-ordered by dragging the columns to the required order. Hide Table Settings by clicking the
                right arrow button next to the Table Settings header.
                The columns can be re-sized by dragging the right side of the desired column heading. The column widths are
                persisted for that search, but reset to default when any new search is executed.

                This column displays a set of icons representing the synchronization status, maintenance mode and Radio Access Technologies of the node.
            </p>

            <b><u>Synchronization Status</u></b>
            <p>
                The synchronization status icon of managed objects such as MeContext, NetworkElement, and ManagedElements without MeContext is shown as <image href="../resources/images/syncError.svg"/>
                when the node is Unsynchronized or <image href="../resources/images/syncing_Animated.svg"/> when the node is Synchronizing/Pending
            </p>


            <b><u>Maintenance Mode</u></b>
            <p>
                The <image href="../resources/images/maintenanceModeIcon.png"/> icon represents nodes undergoing maintenance.
            </p>

            <b><u>Radio Access Technology</u></b>
            <p>The Network Element of type <b>RadioNode</b> can have attribute <b>radioAccessTechnology</b> with one or more 'Attribute Value(s)'.
                Currently radioAccessTechnology can have one or more values from the list <b>[2G, 3G, 4G, 5G]</b>.</p>

            <title>Parent MO</title>
            <p>
                This column displays the immediate Parent of the searched MO. If the searched MO belong to different namespaces 
                with same name, but the immediate parent is same then it displays the same Parent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the searched MO belongs to multiple namespaces on the same nodeType and if the immediate parent is the 
                same then it still displays the same parent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the search results do not appear unique in the result set, by clicking the checkbox of the managed object from the results,
                details in the detail panel will be shown, use the details panel to view the FDN to determine the unique instance identity.

            <p>
                Objects returned in Network Explorer can be selected to save as a Collection, or to launch another application.
                When selecting objects, single selections can be made by clicking the row.
                Multiple selections can be made by clicking the checkboxes of the objects you want to return. You can
                select ranges by clicking the first row, then hold shift and click the last row. The clicked rows and
                all rows in between will be selected. You can select all the objects by clicking the checkbox in the
                table header. After making the selection, you can
                <xref href="../tutorials/collectionsTutorials/collectionsFromSearchResults.xml" type="concept">add these objects to a Collection</xref>, or
                <xref href="../tutorials/searchTutorials/launchApplicationFromNetworkExplorer.xml" type="concept">open other applications directly</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also possible to select an Object by right clicking on it. This will remove any existing
                selections. The Action Bar and right click menu will present Actions specific to that selected Object.

            <title>Actions on Selected Objects</title>
            <p>
                Actions enable you to perform operations on network objects. ENM supports actions across all application sets.
                When objects are selected from <b>Results</b> table, you can perform actions on them by clicking the
                buttons displayed in the Action Bar. You can also right click on the selected object and choose the required
                action.
            </p>
            <p>
                The five most recent performed actions are displayed in the <b>Recent</b> menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                <image href="../resources/images/actionsExample.png" alt="Example actions available on a selection" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Some actions such as <b>Locate in Topology</b> only support a single MO. Other actions such
                as <b>Launch AMOS</b> and <b>Launch Element Manager</b> only support node level objects like
                NetworkElement, MeContext and ManagedElement.
            </p>
            <p>
                All objects are not supported by all applications. If the selected object is not supported try the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Refine your search. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            select all objects of type NetworkElement where NetworkElement has child CmFunction and CmFunction
                            has attr syncStatus = SYNCHRONIZED from node type ERBS
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is also possible to use Topology Browser to find the root object and launch the required application
                    from Topology Browser, by performing the following steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In Network Explorer, select an object in the results table, then click <b>Locate in Topology</b>
                            in the <b>Action Bar</b>. The object you have selected in Network Explorer will be highlighted
                            in Topology Browser. Scroll up until you reach the root object. The root object will
                            be a node level object such as NetworkElement, MeContext or ManagedElement. Click the
                            root object, then click the required action from the <b>Action Bar</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If some actions are temporarily unavailable, a warning message is displayed.
            </p>
            <b>Grouping and Ordering</b>
            <p>
                Similar actions are grouped together. Line separators are used to indicate groupings in both the
                <b>Action Bar</b> and right click menu.
            </p>
            <p>
