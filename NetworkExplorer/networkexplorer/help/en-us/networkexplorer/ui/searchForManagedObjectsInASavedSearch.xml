                To return objects that exist in specific Saved Searches, you can specify the type and Saved Search name
                using the following syntax, replacing [TYPE] and [SEARCH_NAME] with the desired values:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] from search [SEARCH_NAME]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For example - to get all EUtranCellFDD from a Saved Search named locked_cells:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                EUtranCellFDD <b>from search</b> locked_cells
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also use different attribute conditions with the search syntax, like the following:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] from search [SEARCH_NAME] where [ATTRIBUTE_NAME] [OPERATOR] [ATTRIBUTE_VALUE]
            </codeblock>
            <codeblock>
                ENodeBFunction <b>from search</b> dublin_city_center_nodes <b>where</b> eNBId <b>&gt;=</b> 506
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                A Saved Search name containing spaces or special characters should be enclosed within double quotes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example - to view a Saved Search called locked cells:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select search <b>"locked cells"</b>
            </codeblock>
        </section>
