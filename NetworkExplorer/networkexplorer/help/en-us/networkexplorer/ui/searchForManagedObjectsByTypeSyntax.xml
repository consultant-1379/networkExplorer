    <title>Search for Managed Objects by Type</title>

            <p>
                To select Managed Objects you must first specify a type. To do this, use the following syntax,
                replacing [TYPE] with an actual managed object type:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For example, to return all Managed Objects of type ManagedElement, use the following query:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                ManagedElement
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                To search for a Managed Object by type with attributes use the following syntax:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select all objects of type [TYPE] where [ATTRIBUTE_NAME] [OPERATOR] [ATTRIBUTE_VALUE]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For example: to return all Managed Objects of type ManagedElement where the site is Dublin:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                select all objects of type ManagedElement where site = "Dublin"
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b>
                When you specify the same attribute, or any alias for that attribute
                (e.g. name as an alias for MeContextId of the MeContext MO), more than once with an AND and EQUALS
                operators,
                the attribute value specified latest in the query will override the values previously assigned to
                that attribute.
