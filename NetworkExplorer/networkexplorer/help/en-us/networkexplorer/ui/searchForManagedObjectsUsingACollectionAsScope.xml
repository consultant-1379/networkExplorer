            <p>
                To return objects that exist in a specific Collection, as well as any objects under the MOs
                in the Collection, you can specify the type and Collection name
                using the following syntax, replacing [TYPE] and [COLLECTION_NAME] with the desired values:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] using collection [COLLECTION_NAME]
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                For example, to get all EUtranCellFDD objects using as scope a Collection named "dublin_collection"
                containing only node level objects:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                EUtranCellFDD <b>using collection</b> dublin_collection
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                You can also use an attribute condition with the Collection syntax, like the following:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                [TYPE] using collection [COLLECTION_NAME] where [ATTRIBUTE_NAME] [OPERATOR] [ATTRIBUTE_VALUE]
            </codeblock>
            <codeblock>
                EUtranCellFDD <b>using collection</b> dublin_city_center <b>where</b> eNBId <b>&gt;=</b> 507
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                It is also possible to specify one other MO type in the search:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                ENodeBFunction, EUtranCellFD <b>using collection</b> dublin_city_center
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Searches with "using" support only one Collection; so the following queries ar <b>NOT</b> supported:
            </p>
            <codeblock>
                EUtranCellFDD <b>using collection</b> dublin_city_center_A, <b>collection</b> dublin_city_center_B
            </codeblock>
            <codeblock>
                select <b>collection</b> dublin_city_center <b>using collection</b> dublin_collection
            </codeblock>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> When searching with the 'using' keyword in a collection with a large number of MOs, the request may time out if the number of MOs exceeds 500.
